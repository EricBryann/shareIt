The app simulates a social media app, where a user can sign up or login, post pictures with captions, or view what other users have posted. The user can also edit or delete their posts.

This application is built using React for the frontend, Express and Node JS for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The users' passwords are also kept secured using bcrypt, a Node JS library for password hashing. Authorization and Authentication concepts are also applied in this app.
